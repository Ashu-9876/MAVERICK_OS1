# MAVERICK_OS1
Here's a general outline of the process:
Prepare your development environment:

Set up a Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu is commonly used).
Install necessary packages like Java Development Kit (JDK), Git, Python, and other build dependencies.
Install required tools:

Download and install the Android SDK (Software Development Kit) from the official Android website.
Install the Android NDK (Native Development Kit) for building native code.
Install the fastboot and adb tools for device communication and flashing.
Download the source code:

Create a directory where you want to store the source code.
Use Git to clone the AOSP repository by running the following command:

git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest

Set up the build environment:

Navigate to the root directory of the source code.
Run the following command to download the necessary build scripts and dependencies:

source build/envsetup.sh

Configure the build:

Run the lunch command to choose the target device configuration you want to build. For example:

lunch aosp_<device_codename>-userdebug

Build the ROM:

Start the build process by running the following command:

make -j<number_of_threads>

Replace <number_of_threads> with the number of CPU threads you want to allocate for the build (e.g., make -j8).

Wait for the build to complete:

The build process may take a significant amount of time depending on your hardware specifications. Be patient and monitor the output for any errors.

Flash the ROM to a device:

Reboot your device into fastboot mode.

Flash the ROM by running the following command:

fastboot flashall

This command will flash the bootloader, baseband, and the Android system to your device.
Test and enjoy your custom ROM:

Once the flashing process is complete, reboot your device.

Set up the initial device configurations and boot up of our MAVERICK_OS.
